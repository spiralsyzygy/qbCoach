# Regina AI Profile — Deck & Playstyle (Queen’s Blood)

**Source basis**

* Live coaching session: 2025-12-13
* Opponent: Regina (FF7 Rebirth)
* Data sources:

  * Full turn-by-turn observation from the most recent session
  * Prior live-coaching interactions in this chat
  * Repeated card usage and lane behavior across games

This document captures an *observational profile* of Regina’s deck construction, lane priorities, and sequencing habits. It is descriptive, not engine-derived, and should be treated as a matchup guide rather than a rules reference.

---

## 1. Core Deck Identity (Inferred)

**Archetype:** Effect-stacking → delayed payoff

Regina’s deck consistently behaves like a **buff infrastructure engine** that converts into midgame and endgame lane dominance rather than early pressure.

Key traits:

* Early cards are chosen for **persistent effects**, not immediate lane wins
* True scoring power appears only after effects are established
* Lane wins are planned *several turns in advance*

---

## 2. Primary Win Lane: MID

Regina overwhelmingly treats **MID as her primary win condition**.

Observed patterns:

* MID is often left lightly contested early
* Once effects are live, Regina commits **high-impact payoff cards** into MID
* MID is where she extracts the *highest marginal value* from buffs and adjacency

Cards repeatedly used as MID payoffs:

* **Chocobo & Moogle**
* **Ignilisk**
* **Spearhawk** (situational)

MID losses are rarely accidental; when Regina wins MID, it is usually decisive.

---

## 3. Effect Infrastructure Lanes: BOT (and sometimes TOP)

Regina frequently uses **BOT as an effect engine**, not as a lane she expects to win outright.

Observed effect enablers:

* **Crystalline Crab**
* **Amphidex**

Characteristics:

* BOT receives early investment even when it looks inefficient
* These plays are often ignored by human players because they do not immediately threaten a lane win
* Their true value manifests later via buffs that influence MID

BOT may still be won incidentally, but its primary role is **support**, not scoring.

---

## 4. Signature Sequencing Pattern

A recurring and reliable sequence:

1. Deploy **effect cards** (Crystalline Crab, Amphidex) early to midgame
2. Allow opponent to commit geometry elsewhere
3. Drop **MID payoff cards** once buffs are active
4. Force opponent into late, inefficient responses or passes

This creates the illusion of safety until the MID swing happens.

---

## 5. Chocobo & Moogle — High-Confidence Read

Across sessions, Regina:

* Prefers **Chocobo & Moogle in MID**
* Rarely wastes it on side lanes

Reason (inferred):

* MID maximizes adjacency, effect density, and rank conversion
* Buff-heavy states dramatically amplify its impact

Chocobo & Moogle appearing in MID is a **late-game danger signal**.

---

## 6. Behavioral Tendencies

* **Low early pressure:** Regina is comfortable appearing behind early
* **Delayed commitment:** She waits for opponent geometry to lock
* **Punishes over-focus on side lanes:** Especially when MID is left alone
* **Comfortable winning 2–1:** Often sacrifices one lane (usually TOP) cleanly

---

## 7. Practical Matchup Implications (Descriptive)

Against Regina, the following observations hold:

* Ignoring MID for too long is dangerous, even if BOT looks threatening
* Effect cards that appear harmless early often signal a coming MID swing
* Late-game passes usually favor Regina if MID is already compromised

This profile suggests Regina’s strength is not raw power, but **timing and conversion**.

---

## 8. Confidence Level

* **High confidence:** MID priority, effect → payoff sequencing, Chocobo & Moogle usage
* **Medium confidence:** Exact deck list, redundancy of payoff cards
* **Low confidence:** Whether Regina adapts dynamically or follows a fixed heuristic

Further sessions should focus on:

* Whether Regina ever abandons MID as primary lane
* How she responds to early MID denial
* Whether effect stacking varies with opponent behavior

---

*This profile should be updated incrementally as new sessions are observed.*
